title: Memory Usage
description: Optimize memory used by your application in development and production.
---

As applications grow and become more feature rich, they can demand more resources when developing locally or creating production builds.

Let's explore some strategies and techniques to optimize memory and address common memory issues in Next.js.

## Reduce number of dependencies

Applications with a large amount of dependencies will use more memory.

The [Bundle Analyzer](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/bundle-analyzer) can help you investigate large dependencies in your application that may be able to be removed to improve performance and memory usage.

## Record a heap profile

To look for memory issues, you can record a heap profile from Node.js and load it in Chrome DevTools to identify potential sources of memory leaks.

In your terminal, pass the `--heap-prof` flag to Node.js when starting your Next.js build:

```sh
node --heap-prof next build
```

At the end of the build, a `.heapprofile` file will be created by Node.js.

In Chrome DevTools, you can open the Memory tab and click on the "Load Profile" button to visualize the file.

## Analyze a snapshot of the heap

You can use an inspector tool to analyze the memory usage of the application.

When running the `next build` or `next dev` command, add `NODE_OPTIONS=--inspect` to the beginning of the command. This will expose the inspector agent on the default port.
If you wish to break before any user code starts, you can pass `--inspect-brk` instead.

Now, you can use a tool such as Chrome DevTools to connect to the debugging port to record and analyze a snapshot of the heap to see what memory is being retained.

See [how to recored and analyze heap snapshots](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory-problems/heap-snapshots) for more information.

## Webpack build worker

The Webpack build worker allows you to run Webpack compilations inside a separate Node.js worker which will decrease memory usage of your application during builds.

This option is enabled by default if your application does not have a custom Webpack configuration starting in `v14.1.0`.

If you are using an older version of Next.js or you have a custom Webpack configuration, you can enable this option by setting `experimental.webpackBuildWorker: true` inside your `next.config.js`.

> **Good to know**: This feature may not be compatible with all custom Webpack plugins.

## Disable Webpack cache

The [Webpack cache](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/cache/) saves generated Webpack modules in memory and/or to disk to improve the speed of builds. This can
help with performance, but it will also increase the memory usage of your application to store the cached data.

You can disable this behavior by adding a [custom Webpack configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/webpack) to your application:

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  webpack: (
    config,
    { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, nextRuntime, webpack }
  ) => {
    if (cfg.cache && !dev) {
      cfg.cache = Object.freeze({
        type: 'memory',
      })
      cfg.cache.maxMemoryGenerations = 0
    }
    // Important: return the modified config
    return config
  },
}

export default nextConfig
```

## Disable source maps

Generating source maps consumes extra memory during the build process.

You can disable source map generation by adding `productionBrowserSourceMaps: false` and `experimental.serverSourceMaps: false` to your Next.js configuration.

> **Good to know**: Some plugins may turn on source maps and may require custom configuration to disable.

## Edge memory issues

Next.js `v14.1.3` fixed a memory issue when using the Edge runtime. Please update to this version (or later) to see if it addresses your issue.
